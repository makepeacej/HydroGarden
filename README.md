A web application for a starter Hydroponic farm business

Currently under development. I've taken this as an opportunity to learn more about ASP .Net while creating a project that will help a Hydroponic Farm business 
start whenever they get more information. 


Current Idea for the web application:

The user can log in or register to view current or past orders. The user can learn about the company, access contact information, and place orders for
products. The amount will be in pounds but may add the functionality to switch to ounces in the future. 

The owner or employee will access the orders through their login and can mark them as complete. May add the functionality to complete a purchase online, 
but at this time orders will be paid for in person.
